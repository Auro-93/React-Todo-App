## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Beautiful DND (https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) 


### What I learned

This project gave me the opportunity to practice with React.js for the first time and work with components.


### Continued development

My next goal will be to make my code more structured and abstract and delve into React and its hooks beyond the basic ones.
